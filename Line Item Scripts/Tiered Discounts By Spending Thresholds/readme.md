## Tiered Discounts By Spending Thresholds

Similar to the tiered discount script script, this script offers a deal at different monetary levels. This encourages customers to add a new item to their cart to close the gap.

Pura Vida Bracelets has a [time-triggered upsell](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/black-friday-ecommerce-sales) that offers a 10% discount on a purchase of $30 or more.

### What does it do?
Spend over a certain amount, get a certain dollar value off your total order. The default script in this example gives:  
   Spend $30, get a 10% discount  
   Spend $50, get a 15% discount  
   Spend $100, get a 20% discount

You can adjust the spend and discount amounts on lines 4-13.
