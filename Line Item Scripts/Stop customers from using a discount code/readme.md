## Stop customers from using a discount code

You can use a line item script to temporarily stop customers from applying a discount code at checkout. For example, during a Black Friday Cyber Monday sale, this script will tell your customers that their discount code can't be used.

### What does it do?

When running this script, customers will not be able to apply any existing discount codes.
