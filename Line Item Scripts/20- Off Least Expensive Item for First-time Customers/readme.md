It takes a visitor about [13 milliseconds to judge your site](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/the-psychology-of-hero-images-how-to-hook-shoppers-tell-your-story-in-50-milliseconds-or-less), so give the first-timers a chance to get a deal. A quick discount on the least expensive item in the cart is a great way to conclude a purchase, but youâ€™ve got to get that customer through the checkout.

### What does it do?
