## 10% off storewide

Whether itâ€™s a special holiday sale, or a flash sale to attract customers, nothing gets visitors more excited than a storewide discount. A sale like this becomes an event and (when used strategically) can attract visitors and turn them into buyers, and eventually convert them to loyal, repeat customers.

### What it does

Pretty simply, this script will apply 10% off to every item, for every order in your store.
