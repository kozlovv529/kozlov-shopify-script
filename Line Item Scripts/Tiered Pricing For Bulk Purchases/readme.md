## Tiered Pricing for Bulk Purchases

This script provides every buyer an incentive to buy multiples and make a larger order, creating the strange sensation of simultaneous spending and saving.

### What does it do?

By default, you can offer a tiered discount by `product_types` (line 5). Adjust this value according to which product type you would like to offer the tiered discount on (Reflected by the `Product Type` field against your products in the admin).

Lines 8-20 are your discount tiers. For example in the default script it is:  
   Buy 10, get 10% off  
   Buy 50, get 50% off
