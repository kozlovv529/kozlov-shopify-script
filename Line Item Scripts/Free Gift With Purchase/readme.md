## Free Gift With Purchase

A small, unexpected extra can be a wonderful, cost-effective, way to make a customer feel good as they check out. Emazing Lights adds a [free, lightweight item](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/how-to-think-inside-the-box-offer-free-shipping-that-increases-profit-margins) that doesnâ€™t impact shipping costs and can [fit into flat rate containers for customers who reach a certain purchase threshold](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/how-to-think-inside-the-box-offer-free-shipping-that-increases-profit-margins).

### How does it work?

- Define the Product ID of the free gift you want to give away for qualifying purchases
- Change the message you want to displayed to qualifying customers on line 13
- Line 5 checks that there is more than 1 item in the cart in order to qualify
- Customers with at least one regular item and the gift in their cart, will see the gift discounted to $0

_This script requires the customer to manually add the free gift to their cart. Providing a pop up or automatic messaging to customers when they qualify for a free gift would require a different script and the required JavaScript modification to your theme._
