## Buy One Get One Free (BOGO)

A free additional product can compel first and second-time buyers who are on the fence. From Shopify's [previous blog post](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/customer-lifetime-value-after-black-friday-cyber-monday): "At this moment your customer has only made one purchase and the chance of them making a second is just 27%. However, if you can achieve that second purchase, the chance they will make a third jumps significantly to 45%."

### What does it do

Buy one product, get another product(s) for free!

Input `ELIGIBLE_PRODUCT_IDS` for your BOGO - these are products you want to give away as part of your promotion. These are the only products that will be discounted to $0 when accompanying another item in the cart.
You can also input
   `PAID_ITEM_COUNT`: How many items the customer has to buy in order to qualify for the BOGO  
   `DISCOUNTED_ITEM_COUNT`: The maximum number of items a customer can get for free as part of the BOGO
