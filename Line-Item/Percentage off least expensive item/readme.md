## Percentage off least expensive item

You don’t have to be a first-time customer to enjoy a discount. Advertising to people who have already shown interesting in your products (known in the industry as “remarketing”) can lead to a [70% increase in conversions](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/black-friday-ecommerce-sales)!

### How does it work?

This script automatically gives *all* customers 15% off the least expensive item in their cart. Adjust `DISCOUNT_AMOUNT` to offer a different discount amount.
