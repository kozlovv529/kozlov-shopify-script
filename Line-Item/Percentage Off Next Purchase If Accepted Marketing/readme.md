## Percentage Off Next Purchase If Accepted Marketing

Besides making actual sales, getting a customer’s email address is crucial for marketing and retargeting. There are a couple of ways that merchants do this, and one tried and true method is to offer a discount in exchange for the person’s email address.

SkinnyMe Tea offered a [5% discount and a free eating plan](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/email-popups-with-offer-codes-are-the-best-other-ecommerce-optimization-myths) to anyone who gave their email address, and their email opt-ins increased by 758%. Additionally, the discount code improved their sales conversion rates by a full 1%.

### How does it work?  
   Use the `DISCOUNT_AMOUNT` variable on line 2 of the script to define your percentage discount amount (10% by default)  
   If the customer has already made at least one order, and has opted in to marketing, they will receive this discount off their next order automatically
